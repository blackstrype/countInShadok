# Count in Shadok
The objective of this kata is to write a converter from number->shadok and for shadok->number.

## Context
https://www.dcode.fr/shadoks-numeral-system#q1
In the animated series Les Shadoks, the characters only communicate using 4 syllables: Ga, Bu, Zo and Meu. These 4 syllables are used as digits to form base 4 numbers.

Shadoks Numeral System uses the base 4 (quaternary base) with the symbols: GA, BU, ZO and MEU, respectively for 0, 1, 2 and 3. To convert a number (decimal in base 10), write it in base 4 and use the Shadoks' symbols (also called GABUZOMEU).

| Number | Shadok |
| --- | --- |
